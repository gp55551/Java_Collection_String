1. Manipulation in arraylist is slow because it internally uses an array. If any element is removed, all the bits are shifted
in the memory. Manipulation in linkedList is faster because it uses the concept of doubly linked list so no bit shifting is req

2. ArrayList can only act like a list because it implements only list interface while LinkedList can act like List and Queue
because it implements both List and Deque interfaces

3. Arraylist is better for storing and accessing data while LinkedList is better for manipulating data.
